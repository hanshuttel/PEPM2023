\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We have implemented the
editor calculus described by Godiksen et al. \pepm. The implementation
includes a tool for writing editor scripts and different
visualizations of abstract syntax trees that allows the user to move the view around and
zoom in and out of the tree visualization.

As programs get larger, one might want to collapse subtrees. This
comes with certain challenges for visualization. One problem is that if a subtree can be
collapsed, we likely want to ensure that the cursor is not in that
subtree, as the cursor would then be hidden. Similarly, if a subtree
is collapsed, the cursor should not be able to navigate into that
subtree.

One could attempt to evaluate the collapsed subtree and, if it
evaluates to a value, then show this as a summary.

Another feature that would improve usability is to make the default of the view
to follow the cursor when moving through the tree. There are a few different
ways to do it. The editor can follow the cursor with it being centered in the
view. Alternatively it can have the view follow whenever the cursor is near the
edge. For either of these cases, the editor could have a button that moves the
focus back to the cursor, making it possible to toggle between the locked and
the free view.
