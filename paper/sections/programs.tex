\section{Programs}

The program terms that editor expression terms can build and modify are terms of a simply typed $\lambda$-calculus extended with breakpoints and holes. The formation rules are 

\begin{align}
  D & ::= \var{x}
  \mid \const{c}
  \mid \bind{\aamApp}{\tau_1\to\tau_2,\tau_1}  \\ \label{eq:lan-mod-aam}
&  \mid \bind{\aamLambda{x}}{\tau_1\to\tau_2} 
  \mid \aamBreak
  \mid \bind{\aamHole}{\tau} \\ 
  a & ::= x
  \mid c
  \mid \app{a_1}{a_2}
  \mid \abs{\bind{x}{\tau}}{a}
  \mid \cursor{a}
  \mid \breakpoint{a}
  \mid \bind{\hole}{\tau} \label{eq:lan-mod-ast}
\end{align}

The new constructions are $\bind{\aamHole}{\tau}$ which denotes a hole annotated with type $\tau$, $\cursor{a}$ which denotes an expression that is directly underneath the cursor and $\breakpoint{a}$, which is a breakpoint -- meaning that this occurrence of $a$ is left unevaluated.
