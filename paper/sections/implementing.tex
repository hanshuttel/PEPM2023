\section{Implementing the editor calculus}

The implementation of the editor calculus requires

\begin{itemize}
\item implementing the semantics of the calculus and allowing for an
  appropriate visualization of editing
\item implementing a type checker based on the type system
\end{itemize}

but perhaps surprisingly, it involves finding a way to script editor
calculus expressions. In this section we outline this.
