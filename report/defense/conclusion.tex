        \item The implementation closely follows the calculus.
            \pause
        \item The editor is working and is usable.
            \pause
        \item The unfinished parts of the type system have been implemented and our editor now runs with a type checker.
            \pause
        \item Choice of Elm proved a big asset for implementation despite certain hurdles.
            \pause
        \item Previous experience in Elm language was a big plus.
            \pause
        \item Testing would have helped during development.
            \pause
        \item Lack of testing means less confidence in correctness, especially
            for edge cases.
