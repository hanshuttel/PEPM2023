Structure editors can be useful for a multitude of reasons. Most notably is the
elimination of syntax errors by editing abstract syntax trees directly. We have
studied a type-safe structure editor calculus of simple lambda-expressions that
allows partially evaluated programs and use holes to represent missing
subtrees. Our project is to implement this editor calculus in Elm. This paper
will be going through the implementation details using Elm, highlighting the
advantages of the functional language. The implementation is intended as a
proof of concept of the calculus and we strive to model the editor as closely
as possible to the calculus, retaining the guarantees they put forth. The
editor works with configurations of abstract syntax trees and editor
expressions that communicate bidirectionally. We allow for different
visualizations of ASTs and implement the possibility of creating editor
expressions with our editor expression builder, making sure that built
unfinished expression are not able to be evaluated. A partially implemented
type system is discussed and we go through the finished and the problematic
parts of it.
