abstract = {Structure editors make syntax errors impossible, but they still allow construction of programs with incomplete semantics, leading to program states that cannot be evaluated. We introduce a structure editor calculus for a simple functional programming language that allows for incomplete programs. Our editor expressions may interleave construction and evaluation of programs and can thus describe the history of the development of a program. We extend our editor calculus with types and define a resource-aware type system that prohibits editor expressions introducing type errors in the abstract syntax tree and prove that the type system is sound.},

abstract = {Programs are not text; they are hierarchical compositions of computational structures and should be edited, executed, and debugged in an environment that consistently acknowledges and reinforces this viewpoint. The Cornell Program Synthesizer demands a structural perspective at all stages of program development. Its separate features are unified by a common foundation: a grammar for the programming language. Its full-screen derivation-tree editor and syntax-directed diagnostic interpreter combine to make the Synthesizer a powerful and responsive interactive programming tool.},

Alice is a Windows 95/NT tool for describing the time-based and interactive behavior of 3D objects, not a CAD tool for creating object geometry. Our observations and conclusions come from formal and informal observations of hundreds of users. Primary results include the use of LOGO-style egocentric coordinate systems, the use of arbitrary objects as lightweight coordinate systems, the launching of implicit threads of execution, extensive function overloading for a small set of commands, the careful choice of command names, and the ubiquitous use of animation and undo.},
